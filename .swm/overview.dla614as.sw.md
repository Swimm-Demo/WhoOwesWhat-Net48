WhoOwesWhat-Net48 is a system designed to manage and track debts and credits among friends, allowing users to keep track of who owes what to whom.

## Main Components

### Service Controllers

Service Controllers are interfaces that define the contract for various operations related to users, errors, synchronization, and friend requests. They are responsible for handling the logic and interactions between the service layer and the underlying data repositories, ensuring that the appropriate actions are taken based on the requests they receive.

### Service Configuration

Service configuration involves setting up various parameters and dependencies required for the application to function correctly. This includes configuring database connections, logging mechanisms, dependency injection, and handling cross-origin requests. Proper configuration is essential for the application to operate seamlessly across different environments and to facilitate maintenance and updates.

### Deployment Scripts

Deployment scripts automate the process of building, packaging, and deploying the application to various environments, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors.

### Data Provider Interfaces

Data Provider Interfaces define the contract for data operations, ensuring a consistent way to handle data access and manipulation across different entities like groups, friends, and transactions.

### Data Provider

Data Provider refers to the component responsible for managing data access and manipulation. It includes logic for updating entities, mapping data between different layers, and ensuring data consistency. The Data Provider plays a crucial role in abstracting the data access layer, allowing for easier testing and maintenance of the codebase.

### Domain Logic

Domain Logic refers to the part of the application that encodes the business rules, processes, and logic specific to the problem domain. It is responsible for implementing the core functionality and behavior of the system, such as handling transactions, managing relationships between entities, and enforcing business rules. Domain Logic ensures that the system operates according to the defined business requirements and constraints.
